Chhallenge: HotelDoor

Description: I thought I'd come down to Florida on a vacation. I thought I left work behind me! What's at my hotel door when I show up? A Silly reverse engineering puzzle to get into my hotel room! I thought I was supposed to relax this weekend. Instead of me doing it, I hired you to solve it for me. Let me into my hotel room and you'll get some free internet points!
